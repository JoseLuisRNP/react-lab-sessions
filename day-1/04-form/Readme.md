# 04 Form

In this example we are going to implement the basic login functionallity,
accesing a mock service to validation user and password, the only thing
we are not going to implement is form validation.

We will take a startup point sample _03-layout_.

Summary steps:

- Link the navigation to the login button.
- Get the data from the textFields.
- Create a service that will simulate an async user password validation.
- Validate login and navigate to hotels list if validation passes.
- Excercises: add a notification component.

## Prerequisites

Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) if they are not already installed on your computer.

> Verify that you are running at least node v8.x.x and npm 5.x.x by running `node -v` and `npm -v`
> in a terminal/console window. Older versions may produce errors.

## Steps to build it

- Copy the content of the `03-layout` folder to an empty folder for the sample.

- Install the npm packages described in the [./package.json](./package.json) and verify that it works:

```bash
npm install
```
